#Desiging a Circuit for computing Greatest Common Diviser(GCD):

In this project, we designed a circuit to compute the GCD of two 32-bit integers numbers. To compile and run the test, you need to either install [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) (free) or to use Cadence Simvision (need to purchase license). The script works with both simvision and iverilog. To view the waveforms, you can use [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/)(free) or Simvision. To run the test,
first you need to clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/hossein1387/random_hw_experiments.git
    cd random_hw_experiments/GCD

Then, to compile and execute the following command:

    ./do_test.cmd

For Simvision only, you can add gui to command to bring up simulator:

    ./do_test.cmd gui

Either way, the GCDTest.sv will instantiate the designed GCD module and tests it by randomly injecting two integers. The GCDTest.sv is responsible to provide the clock and inputs for the Design Under Test (DUT). It also is responsible to verify the DUT outputs. The DUT will notify test when to pickup the output by pulling up the done bit for a clock cycle. The result of running this test will be as follow:

    ncsim> run
    [   1]-GCD(  97, 532): expected=   1   actual=   1  PASS
    [   2]-GCD( 718, 114): expected=   2   actual=   2  PASS
    [   3]-GCD( 979, 862): expected=   1   actual=   1  PASS
    [   4]-GCD(  90,  65): expected=   5   actual=   5  PASS
    [   5]-GCD( 409, 134): expected=   1   actual=   1  PASS
    ...
    [  99]-GCD( 658, 566): expected=   2   actual=   2  PASS
    [ 100]-GCD( 525, 605): expected=   5   actual=   5  PASS
    Simulation complete via $finish(1) at time 600 US + 0

The output shows the expected result (generated by the test) versus the actual result (calculated by the dut).
